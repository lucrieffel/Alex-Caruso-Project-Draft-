# Alex-Caruso-Project-Draft-
I attempt to evaluate and justify Alex Caruso's increase in playing time using data from the 2019-2020 regular season and playoffs. See README for more information...


In this project I review Alex Caruso's performance through his 2019-2020 regular season and playoff data. I examine his playing time in relation to metrics such as win shares and game score that evaluate an NBA players collective performance on the offensive and defensive end of the floor. I plug his regular season data into a linear regression model to see if there was a significant positive linear relationship between his game score and minutes played. I researched his hustle statistics to attempt to evaluate his value on the court that most mainstream statistics would not account for.
